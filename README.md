# Advanced Econometrics: Qualitative Variables Analysis

This repository contains advanced econometric modeling performed during my Master of Research (MSc) in Finance at **IHEC Carthage**. The project focuses on modeling non-linear relationships and categorical data using **Stata**.

## 📊 Key Models Implemented
* **Binary Choice Models:** Logistic and Probit regressions used to predict success probabilities (Pseudo $R^2$: 0.638).
* **Ordered Outcomes:** Ordered Logistic Regression (`ologit`) to analyze ranked variables (e.g., sales performance).
* **Count Data:** Implementation of Poisson and Negative Binomial regressions.
* **Diagnostics:** Multivariable correlation matrices, significance testing ($p < 0.05$), and Log-Likelihood optimization.

## 🛠️ Tools & Files
* **Software:** Stata 17/18
* **`23-10-2025.smcl`**: Comprehensive Stata log file containing all commands and outputs.
* **Methodology:** Application of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Marginal Effects analysis.

## 🎓 Academic Context
This work is part of the **Econometrics of Qualitative Variables** course, demonstrating the ability to handle complex financial datasets that go beyond standard linear regressions.
